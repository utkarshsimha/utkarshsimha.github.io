                        <ul>
                            <li> The project aims at estimating the intrinsic dimensionality of the low-dimensional manifold of a given dataset </li>
                            <li> For example, given a very high dimension (say 1024x1024) pictures of a teapot turning on a turntable, we want to find the axis of rotation (which is a 2-D circle). </li>
                            <li> For this, we use a statisical method based on the initialization used by KMeans++ and scale it for huge amounts of data on Apache Spark. </li>
                            <li> Code for this can be found <a href="https://github.com/utkarshsimha/dimensionality-estimation">here </a> </li>

                            <li> The project aims at generating objective type questions for video lectures </li>
                            <li> Explored various techniques that might work for this task, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Recurrent Neural Networks</li>
                            <li> Used part-of-speech and named-entity-recognition taggers to identify specific parts of the sentences, and used a knowledge graph (ConceptNet) to generate the questions </li>

                            <li> Tried various architectures such as vanilla feed-forward neural networks, end-to-end recurrent neural networks etc. </li>
                            <li> The final architecture was based on a end-to-end recurrent neural network which uses Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss and a beam search mechanism for predicting phonemes </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li> The project aims at integrating Openstack and enterprise key lifecylce managers, such as IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager (IBM SKLM), using standardized protocols such as Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) </li>
                            <li> Used a server-side plugin architecture to translate KMIP requests received by Barbican (the key manager for Openstack) and delegate it to any enterprise key lifecycle manager that has been interfaced</li>
                            <li> Successfully demonstrated an end-to-end scenario for important key operations. Submitted and presented a white paper based on the project at IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing and Emerging Markets 2015 which was accepted for poster presentation </li>

                        <h4> Acoustic Embeddings for speech recognition </h4>
                        Built a Variational Autoencoder to construct acoustic embeddings at a word level for the task of speech recognition. The embeddings tries to map acoustically similar words together. This can be used to improve the performance of the speech recognizer in noisy environments. Code for this can be found <a href="https://github.com/utkarshsimha/deep-learning/blob/master/tf_acoustic_embeddings.py">here.</a>

                        <h4> Adversarial Expamples on Inception </h4>
                        Constructed adversarial examples which try to <i>fool</i> the Inception model, based on <a href="http://www.anishathalye.com/2017/07/25/synthesizing-adversarial-examples/">this</a> blog. The iPython notebook for this can be found <a href="https://github.com/utkarshsimha/adversarial-examples">here. </a> <br/>
                        Plan to improve this by making it robust to transformations, and also build a tutorial in PyTorch.

                        <h4> Northern Lights: A Simple Personal Assistant </h4>
                        Built a simple personal assistant by stitching together multiple APIs available. 
                        This uses <i>Snowboy from kitt.ai</i> for hotword detection, <i>Google Speech Recognition</i> (online) and <i>CMU Sphinx</i> (offline) for speech recognition, <i>Stanford NLP</i> for performing some basic NER tagging and <i>Wolfram API</i> for knowledge querying
                        Plan to improve it in the future by adding face and voice fingerprinting for personalization, as well as intent mining and NLU to provide more functionality.

                <p>
                    I play the piano, guitar and sometimes the flute. I post some of my piano recordings on my
                    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/utkarsh-hiker" target="_blank"> soundcloud channel </a> and my
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/utkarshsimha" target="_blank"> YouTube channel </a>
                    <br/><br/>
                    I am also an ardent trekker. I have trekked to Everest Base Camp, Dzongri and Manmahesh in the Himalayas, and many
                    smaller treks in and around Karnataka.
